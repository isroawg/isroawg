## Guidelines for Publications

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the publications of the Indian Subcontinental Research & Operational Analytical Working Group (ISROAWG). To ensure consistency and quality across our publications, we have established the following guidelines:

1. **Relevance**: Submissions should be relevant to the scope of our research areas, including international conflicts, national security, military movements, defense studies, and strategies within the Indian Subcontinent.

2. **Originality**: We encourage original research and analysis that offers unique insights and perspectives. Please ensure that your submission has not been previously published elsewhere.

3. **Clarity**: Present your ideas in a clear and concise manner. Use appropriate language and avoid excessive technical jargon to ensure accessibility to a wide range of readers.

4. **Structure**: Organize your publication with a logical structure, including an introduction, main body, and conclusion. Use subheadings where necessary to enhance readability.

5. **Citations and References**: Provide proper citations and references for all sources used in your publication. Follow a consistent citation style, such as APA or MLA, and include a bibliography or reference list at the end.

6. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure that your publication adheres to ethical standards. Properly acknowledge the contributions of others and avoid plagiarism or any form of academic misconduct.

7. **Formatting**: Format your publication in a readable manner, using appropriate font styles, sizes, and spacing. Include figures, tables, or graphs as necessary to support your findings.

8. **Submission**: Submit your publication in digital format, preferably in PDF or Word document. Include an abstract or summary along with your submission.

Please note that all submitted publications will undergo a review process by our editorial team. We will evaluate the relevance, quality, and adherence to the guidelines before making a decision on acceptance for publication.
